Chat challenge
==============

Run Client (from the root of the project):
  ```
  cd ./client && npm install && npm start
  ```

Run Server (from the root of the project):
  ```
  cd ./server && npm install && npm start
  ```

To build Client using webpack from create-react-app:
  ```
  cd ./client && npm build
  ```

MISSING REQUIREMENTS:
  1. When the user is typing, indication that they are typing should be shown to the other user.
  3. When a new message arrives, it should slide in, and the messages above slide up


IF HAD MORE TIME:
  * TESTS on server / client - rendering and on ui logic
  * better and more commit msgs
  * prettier chat bubbles
